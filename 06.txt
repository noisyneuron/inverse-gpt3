great...
but where are all the mutants?

i am now profoundly convinced
that beauty gave us morons

enter the institute for the lustfully insane and the little  girls they called for parties- and the hell meaning charlatans asking comments for the story

i'm killing for a nice bagel and iced coffee
going on a daytime walk to nowhere
without being scared
of breathing on someone's coughs

meeting someone to call my partner
someone that could call me baby
seems  like a bad idea now

learn to make your own coffee
listen to beats online
get very high

just kidding,
i am too  scared to smoke these days

i try to follow the guidelines
i am doing okay for now
learn to be six six six six six six six  feet away

Have you
forgotten
how
lonely
 it feels to be alive.

Maybe I should have died
back then
when I was loved and
greeted
as something else
than a starving addict



a dead rat.
