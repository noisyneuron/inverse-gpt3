Have you
forgotten
how
lonely
 it feels to be alive.

In that moment
You were
The sun

With all the light
Of softest dawn

And just as cold
Just as lonely
Far away

In that moment
You held
In your eyes
A wavering hope

Encouraged by doubt
Pushed onward by fear

Undaunted, unveiled
Unbelievably distant
Yet still in my arms
Still right here
Where you belong

I'll wipe the mercury
Off your cheeks

Bring warmth
To flesh and bone

And when you speak
So soft, so meek
I'll know that I've brought you
Safely home

tell divinity
not to enter

south hour pillowed
in the gigantic day

scream
something
certain

a whisper
eternal

the walls
can hear you.

are we growing
or just going
in circles

supposedly it aint linear
apparently it never was.

i think we're hoping that we won't get lost in this hole
but who's to say... anything

they say there's galaxies out there
but to be honest they sound pretty vague and
somehow, confident

who lives in these galaxies?
what happens in these galaxies?

i imagine a marvelous rhinoceros
and an elegant giraffe
dancing and walking at the same time
in sync

i guess what is vague
might actually be more marvelous.

are we growing
or just going
in circles

are they asking the same thing
in these other  galaxies.

it feels like a staggering vastness
made up of individuals
(individuals are made up)

are we just going in circle
or are we growing
in galaxies.

are we getting old?
apparently.

but we keep hoping
that in trusted time,
we'll make our way to these galaxies
with our bags in hand
so that
we can ... continue
continue to go in...  circles

And you just look at me

With eyes that don't shine

And this goddamn life

And it sucks

And I'm afraid

Of everything

Myself

To everything

Myself

And I don't want to

Watch you watch me

Or the way that I'm living my life

Cause I just see

The end

Of myself

Of myself

And I don't want to see

Just where I'm going to

Or where you've been

Or where you've been

Just where you've been

To this day

Or to this place

Or this place

Or this place

I just want to

Escape my face

No this aint gonna go

No this aint gonna fly

No this aint gonna work

No this aint gonna last

And you just look at me

With eyes that don't shine

And this goddamn life

And it sucks

And I'm afraid

Of everything

Myself

To everything

Myself

And I don't want to

Watch you watch me

Or the way that I'm living my life

Cause I just see

The end

Of myself

Of myself

And I don't want to see
