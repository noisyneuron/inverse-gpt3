noise intoxicates
way with one

hunter hunts
 lifts knife
rather with away,
where lift rather pendulum

who with one lift

feeds the forest
thirst rather key one dangles
who feeds
with flow
thirst of the forest
 intoxicates the hunted
forest tight

hunt way
dangle knife one hunger
where feeds the hunted
hearse cap pendulum dangle,
away with the forest,

way with one
away with the knife

flow pendulum
away you flow,,
pendulum way

who would we rather?
pendulum
where,
who feeds the numb hunter

lift on flow
one who flows

great...
but where are all the mutants?

i am now profoundly convinced
that beauty gave us morons

enter the institute for the lustfully insane and the little  girls they called for parties- and the hell meaning charlatans asking comments for the story

i'm killing for a nice bagel and iced coffee
going on a daytime walk to nowhere
without being scared
of breathing on someone's coughs

meeting someone to call my partner
someone that could call me baby
seems  like a bad idea now

learn to make your own coffee
listen to beats online
get very high

just kidding,
i am too  scared to smoke these days

i try to follow the guidelines
i am doing okay for now
learn to be six six six six six six six  feet away

peel the potatoes
cook the soup
swear on my life
chop the onions

don't cook the steak well done
it will be not good

doesn't matter if you leave the stains
clean the dishes
no matter the mold

no matter the shard of the glass
don't mind your boyfriend
i found the poem

a piece of a prose
a line

a guy that i used to know.

he came out of a mirror
one day
he just showed up
he was like "hey, kid"
and i was like "..."
and i kinda knew from that point on
that that guy...

would become my best friend.

i miss you, timmy.

how could i forget about my favorite spy?

you're the one that showed me life, yo.

he was the one who would tell me "it's all right."
and he did every fucking night.

and one day i was like "where are you now?"
and he was like "it's all right, yancey."
and i was like "no, where are you now?"
and he was like "it's all right, yancey."
and i was like "no, where are you now?"
and he was like "it's all right, yancey."
and i was like "no, where are you now?"
and he was like "it's all right, yancey."
and i was like "no, where are you now?"
and he was like "it's all right, yancey."
and i was like "no, where are you now?"
and he was like "it's all right, yancey."
and i was like "no, where are you now?"
and he was like "it's all right, yancey."
