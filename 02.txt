have you ever wondered if
the clouds are time
or poetry
danger
lies in the ocean floor
while space, in fragments
belies the death
breathe, spoke the whale
have you have i
if have
if time
wished
upon joy
fame and glory

vec3(1000.0,fbm(x),smoothstep(x,t,(x - t)))



the tail craves
a belly

please,  maybe
I,  another

you cannot count it a find.
much too small to sell.

alone in a room.
day and day
I pray for them to bring it.

in athens
I hear they sell
wood brought in from the shaw
a terrible life away.

what a scam,
they count the coins
so small and light

Have you
forgotten
how
lonely
 it feels to be alive.

what the fuck?
when will you get up off the floor?
how much longer will you make us wait?
the anger rages. the ashes fall.

These waters form a pool
That holds a crowd
Though you might think it's been a fool

And watch them all drown in a sea of fear
For their numbers ever increase
Though my life won't be in their fate

Throttled and thrown
to a place far below

But if you open your eyes
you'll find a whale
that takes you with it's might
and carries you there

vec3(fract((x * 10.0)),fract((y * 10.0)),fract((z * 10.0)))



between you and me,
it's hard to draw a line
and i don't know what to say,
i'm not who you were looking for
i'm not who you were looking for

'cause every time you say goodbye
i hear you crying, i hear you crying
and i hear you screaming,
i hear you screaming in my head

vec3(fbm(x),fbm(y),fbm(z))



that's it.
oh god, it's such a mess.
you'd best go home now.
