Have you
forgotten
how
lonely
 it feels to be alive.

its a nightmare living with you

you snore like a rhinoceros

apparently its normal

it is supposed to grow on me

vec3(0.10414062882773578,x,sin((y * t)))



the tail craves
a belly

please,  maybe
I,  another

you cannot count it a find.
much too small to sell.

alone in a room.
day and day
I pray for them to bring it.

in athens
I hear they sell
wood brought in from the shaw
a terrible life away.

what a scam,
they count the coins
so small and light

the low sun touches
the high cliff
it has been a long time
since ive seen you
i wish you had stayed
i hope youre alright.

vec3(0.10216593018549954,x,sin((y * t)))



they say in the late
summer light
you could see the shaw
to the south
dont get lost
dont let the forest keep you away

vec3(0.11710351891815662,x,fbm(x))



the trees that hide the
past will soon let it out
and ive seen
how dark the night gets
when a love is lost.

You wouldnt like me
when im angry

Do not touch me
you bastard.

vec3(0.10414062882773578,x,sin((y * t)))



the morning sky holds
off for the evening
and soon the forest
will show its hand.

vec3(0.11710351891815662,x,fbm(x))



two strings held up

strung across the heavens
a sapphire of trust.

vec3(0.11710351891815662,x,fbm(x))



i could never say
how glad i am
that they never put

us together in school

A whisper
in my ear
a calm
on my skin

a thread that binds us.

vec3(0.11710351891815662,x,fbm(x))



its so strange

that now

this place

means something to me

I cant see the woods

or the trees for the fog

they tell me

its normal

and that
