tubes cruelly curved
separating boundary snow

grow another moment for continuum
grow pulses against the cold cold cold

tubes may last but I will not

this day is crazy
pillowed
by gigantic clouds
cloudy, foggy
smoky, hazy
no sun to rise up.

make some noise
it is the hour of insanity.
replace the calm
create a storm
nothing has any meaning
what could possibly rise up
from this madness.

this crystal keeps me safe

i never considered the possibility
that it might be a farce!

in theory it is not impossible
but i cannot believe it is true

death waits for me to stop believing

like four seasons autumn spring

summer fall and winter
life goes on and i carry on

i watch the train of my dreams carry away

it all will change some day.

constantly looking back

so much i regret

if only i had the chance

but there is nothing i can do

there are stars i hope i reach

but i feel like a bug

sitting on the edge of a fence

this is my life i cry

because i have seen all this before

time is filled with endless possibilities

people and places we have never seen

memories we can revisit anytime

have never been seen, yet still real

yet we wait for death

how can life be?

we do not know, but it is

we have our own fears and demons

however strange they are

it is a big deal

to spend eternity in one spot

it is easy to be a prisoner

at least if you are free to go

your thoughts will soar and fly

through the time and space and land

if time is endless

what is the point?

my eyes are blind and my brain is numb

yet i am awake and aware

my mind has been freed

there is only one thing that i truly want

all i need

yet i cannot have

i will try to stay patient

but i know i will fail

though i try and try i still cannot make

the right thing to say

wait and never get to hear the words i love

wait and watch as the world moves on

oh, what a sad mess i have become

i really want to cry, but i can't

there are tears that will never fall

there is not a single moment that will matter

i just wait and watch the time run down

day after day

i will live my life

until the dreamer

will wake me

that is the only way

i can ever get a chance

to be myself.

i must wait

and try to pass the time

my mind is slowly slipping away

but i won't let the dreamer wake me.

i want to see the end of the dream

because i can't take the dreamer's heat

i don't care if i die

the only thing i have is the will to live

i need my dream to make it through

i wish i could rest.

this race is nothing

it is a meaningless race

all i want is for the dreamer to wake me

i know i cannot have it

i could live forever like this

but it is not a life at all

the endlessness is what is so horrid

what use am i to the world if i cannot feel?

i can't eat

i can't drink

i can't talk

i can't sleep

i am just a vessel

i have no way to express myself

that is what i wish the dreamer would bring me

i know it cannot be

but i will not stop hoping

and waiting

and wishing

and praying

and loving

and being
