In that moment
You were
The sun

With all the light
Of softest dawn

And just as cold
Just as lonely
Far away

In that moment
You held
In your eyes
A wavering hope

Encouraged by doubt
Pushed onward by fear

Undaunted, unveiled
Unbelievably distant
Yet still in my arms
Still right here
Where you belong

I'll wipe the mercury
Off your cheeks

Bring warmth
To flesh and bone

And when you speak
So soft, so meek
I'll know that I've brought you
Safely home

I wanted my tail to growl
So I brought my belly some pebbles.

It was a day for a shaw
- a cool day,  like Athens in October.
Let's not go away just yet.

Above doves and sky, claps below -
too fast to count;
We were small but not alone.

Take me there.

When you get to the door,

Please don't ask him to see his poem.

No point to look inside,

You'll see his light and the evening through the door.

I had a dream, I can't remember now,

I was driving through a ghost town.

The gas station had faces,

Old signs, the kind you'd never notice,

White dog, gas down to $1.69 a gallon.

I heard a song once,

Lyrics too loud to ignore;

Voices were calling,

And you wanted to go back.

Sirens howling, and drums were loud,

Like a battle cry.

"Why did we go there?"

I asked, and you replied,

"It just seemed like a good place to go."

I don't remember why,

But we never went back.

You said, "There's no one here."

I think we left him for dead.

When he was sleeping

I heard a song, like distant drums.

I wonder if I would have stayed.

You'd have been so happy

But we never went back.

We should have stayed,

Should have let him live,

Should have let him go
