have you ever wondered if
the clouds are time
or poetry
danger
lies in the ocean floor
while space, in fragments
belies the death
breathe, spoke the whale
have you have i
if have
if time
wished
upon joy
fame and glory

vec3(1000.0,fbm(x),smoothstep(x,t,(x - t)))




oh hips - please, spare us!
i'm deep down low and wantin' (oof)

vast space swallows the ground
where you last see me fawning...

another move, then shut the day,
it's logical but haunting.
i'll tell you what, we take a day,
to spin those levels lawning.

stop time control from coming.
who knows what foothills we would razz, if people weren't there watching?

again i say - it's coming

vec3(min(x,ceil(6.0)),min(sqrt(asin(x)),fbm(vec2(sin(ceil(20000.0)),sin(40000.0)))),700000.0)




a growing unrest
just a small cube of space to move in
it starts to get old.

we are interdependent -
you, me
the galaxies in our minds

getting lost deeper in this hole
a vague sense of time lingers
as we start to get old.

just a memory remains
of time ... before
before this strange strange... predicament
will it ever return?

now that we are "clear"
of the aperture
i see stars
and you.

all's we need's a pen
to sketch the death

of these colors and patterns

with precision.

together, the stars are amazing.

vec3(1000.0,fbm(x),smoothstep(x,t,(x - t)))




i might go slow and long
towards the long road
and down the hill
to make a long song
with light and stars and birds
and grass and things
in my own private way
alone

vec3(min(x,ceil(6.0)),min(sqrt(asin(x)),fbm(vec2(sin(ceil(20000.0)),sin(40000.0)))),(i)Ë†(i + 1))


this world has grown cold
making monsters of those who live long
we find our selves not real
we are the lenses and the shadows.

there will come a time
we will be one again
a sense of remorse
for this cruel struggle
as one among many.

so let's go further in
we're on an unstable line
it's nothing but a dream
with eyes no one can find.

i don't know what happens next
all i know is not my plight
this feeling in the atmosphere
let's not pretend.

as one among many

one among many...

vec3(x * (time / 0.06),fbm(x,(x * (0.079 - x)) * 0.05),0.5 + 0.5 * smoothstep(x,t,x * (0.5 + y)))




it feels so familiar
like an old dream
where everything is the same.

i can see what you see
i can feel what you feel
there is something new
the world has moved.

and it happens every day
in every place i go
i can see what you see
i can feel what you feel
there is something new
the world has moved.

some are running for their lives
trying to hide but there's no one to save them
some are stranded on this road
it feels like every day's the same.

vec3(x * (distance / 5.5),fbm(x,(x * (0.03 - x)) * 0.03),0.5)




i need more sleep
an in - si - de out!
it's getting old.

beyond a dream and a wish
beyond a hope
beyond ourselves

what do we find?

i feel ill
and i feel a cold coming.

do you see this place?
i think it's changing.

the scenes are scenes no more.

there is a strangeness in this change.

beyond the space of reason.
where is this road?

has it gone?

beyond a dream and a wish
beyond a hope
beyond ourselves
what do we find?

vec3(y + sin(t),fbm(x,(x * (0.02 - x)) * 0.02),sin(t) * smoothstep(x,t,x * (0.0 + y)))




dust clouds slowly roll by
distant shapes of red and white

sometimes grass and rock and a tree

up ahead

do we have a hope in hell?

maybe one step further to go

can we make a home in this cold empty void?

fades my hope of what is real

can we work things out?

is there a light on in the hole?

the sun is to the horizon...

clear blue water shimmers.

i stand still.

vectors combine.

let's go out.

vec3(1.0,fbm(x,(x * (0.06 - x)) * 0.05),(x * (0.08 - x)) + 0.01)




and slowly drift off in sleep

to a world in my mind

a world that makes sense

to a life without care

and remember in this dream

that i need no explanation

on what's there and what's not

because there's nothing at all

and all i do is wait

i wait for some relief

vec3(x * (distance / 1.0),fbm(x,(x * (0.0 + x)) * 0.05),1.0 + 1.0 * smoothstep(x,t,x * (2.0 + y)))




we don't belong here

no more than any other

get out of here

no. not too soon!

maybe this isn't the place for us

but to face that may not be easy.

then again we're no stranger

maybe this is no other...

become transparent

become absolute

take this world away from me...

climb to the sky

conceive another

in a world where i am free

"hey it's going to be alright!"

an attractive world

with no pain and sorrow

with no time or space or care

"everything's going to be alright!"

i feel safe...

the more i see the deeper i want to go

there's a strange energy up here

i'm ascending out of reach

there's a strange strange strange... strange feeling here

then everything just stops

there's no place to move to

there's no place to move to...

vec3(x * (distance / 3.0),fbm(x,(x * (0.08 - x)) * 0.03),(x * (0.1 - x)) + 0.015)




do i see you there?

are you blind too?

can you see me?

are you blind?

can you read me?

can you read me?

can you read me?

can you read me?

can you read
