Have you
forgotten
how
lonely
 it feels to be alive.

In that moment
You were
The sun

With all the light
Of softest dawn

And just as cold
Just as lonely
Far away

In that moment
You held
In your eyes
A wavering hope

Encouraged by doubt
Pushed onward by fear

Undaunted, unveiled
Unbelievably distant
Yet still in my arms
Still right here
Where you belong

I'll wipe the mercury
Off your cheeks

Bring warmth
To flesh and bone

And when you speak
So soft, so meek
I'll know that I've brought you
Safely home

tell divinity
not to enter

south hour pillowed
in the gigantic day

scream
something
certain

a whisper
eternal

the walls
can hear you.

are we growing
or just going
in circles

supposedly it aint linear
apparently it never was.

i think we're hoping that we won't get lost in this hole
but who's to say... anything

they say there's galaxies out there
but to be honest they sound pretty vague and
somehow, confident

who lives in these galaxies?
what happens in these galaxies?

i imagine a marvelous rhinoceros
and an elegant giraffe
dancing and walking at the same time
in sync

i guess what is vague
might actually be more marvelous.

are we growing
or just going
in circles

are they asking the same thing
in these other  galaxies.

it feels like a staggering vastness
made up of individuals
(individuals are made up)

are we just going in circle
or are we growing
in galaxies.

are we getting old?
apparently.

but we keep hoping
that in trusted time,
we'll make our way to these galaxies
with our bags in hand
so that
we can ... continue
continue to go in...  circles

we will have years and
we will have memories
a number will have sorrows
you will be a lot and the

other will be zero

there will be directions

thats where we go

when we go down

vec3(y,abs((sign(atan(fbm(x))) * y)),atan(abs((sign(atan(fbm(x))) * (sin(y))))))


And yet
Here we are

Caught in the hollows

Awaiting

The day.

Vec3f(c,2,2)


And in these hollows
These hallows
So full of me

I ask again

for more love

vec3(0.4924078740718382,fbm(step(8.0,abs(sin(r(mod(y,8)))))))


Without loneliness
there is no fullness

where would the rings come from

where would the islands spring from

they would be

They would exist

just out of reach

and suddenly

would have it all

and these hollows

these hallows

so full of me

exist only because of all the holes

the hollows

I reach to them

they are me

in these holes

the depth

the pit

I'll find the islands

where I am.

Then the word for the day was child

And the children

fled their minds

We all looked on

And the wind

was unkind

But the mind was big

and they wondered

If it would all blow away

The whole thing

vec3(0.5,0.5,0.5)


Are we so full of time

that we don't have time for love

and all that love requires

No,

we're full of something else

Time

But not always

Sometimes

Time.
