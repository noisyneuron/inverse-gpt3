As your hips sway,
I'm not thinking logical
Deep longings emerge
Why can't I be logical about this?
This day seems to never end
What cha doing later?
Later in the day?
'mmm'
'please go away'
away?
'Yes, please'
'Do you realize how inappropriate you're being?'
'I almost thought this office would be safe from harassment'

on the floor that night
we drank poison
felt you hold my neck
sticky, warm

ha cha cha

we drank too much poison
but I was overprotected
and you felt overprotected too
thumping bass moved us

but the bubble popped
your sticky hands... repulse me
your breath smells sweet
you ask for my number... I'm
never calling

in a moment we find time
in only a moment

with tubes curved

grow and grow - aeons apart

a long way away

we pull away
at exactly the same time

we're inches apart but can't see
one watches

do you get it?
you had
a bun
a cappuccino
they're both
different shades of tan
if you wanted me to
I would turn red and stand
like a speckled hen
we don't want to disturb you
you've been disturbed by women before

do you remember?
we were up all night
and now we're up
can you wake me up?
I've been dreaming of you
all night

distance is no indication of feelings
instead
distance is space between actions
me

in between my feelings for you
and you

in between my feelings for you

and

your feelings for me

a cappuccino?
would you like a latte?
you didn't bring anything
maybe i'll make you something.
milk, cream, sugar, spices, foam, and then
try to find out your name

come inside. I want you to be happy.
We've got time. You're not late.
Whose time is it? Whose days?
Whose time is it? Who's late?
Where are they?
Why can't I find them?

I'm outside and don't want to be.
Everything is wrong
I don't know how to tell my dad
he doesn't know that I'm not alone
I don't know why I'm scared of
this ancient hallway
I hate the ghosts here
they follow me
my life will be an open book
with air to breathe,
which do you choose?

                              ,

the moon smiles
the air sings
but I'm depressed
and you're gorgeous
after my shower
after another shower
my hand moves to you
and you moan
even in your sleep
I never want to wake you
but you shiver
and the frost sets in
I know there's still time
you just need more
more sleep, more caffeine, more me.

daddy is kind
he tells me to leave you alone
if you don't want me
i'll do what you want
I'll try
but how can I forget you?

I'm still afraid
of the frost
I don't know how I'm supposed to
get you to notice me
my heart tries to change
to match my emotions
but it gets more lukewarm
vec3(asin(sin((0.01847377058081247 * (fbm((x + y)))) * 2.0)),asin(sin((0.01847377058081247 * (fbm((x + y)))) * 2.0)),asin(sin((0.01847377058081247 * (fbm((x - y)))) * 2.0)) + 1.0))

my heart becomes a glacier
it hurts when I touch it
the snow falls in a white haze
sometimes I make it snow
but then I think of you
like a cheetah,
or a gazelle,
or a musk ox
I mean a blizzard
I don't mean a tundra
