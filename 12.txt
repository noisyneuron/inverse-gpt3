have you ever wondered if
the clouds are time
or poetry
danger
lies in the ocean floor
while space, in fragments
belies the death
breathe, spoke the whale
have you have i
if have
if time
wished
upon joy
fame and glory

In that moment
You were
The sun

With all the light
Of softest dawn

And just as cold
Just as lonely
Far away

In that moment
You held
In your eyes
A wavering hope

Encouraged by doubt
Pushed onward by fear

Undaunted, unveiled
Unbelievably distant
Yet still in my arms
Still right here
Where you belong

I'll wipe the mercury
Off your cheeks

Bring warmth
To flesh and bone

And when you speak
So soft, so meek
I'll know that I've brought you
Safely home

I wanted my tail to growl
So I brought my belly some pebbles.

It was a day for a shaw
- a cool day,  like Athens in October.
Let's not go away just yet.

Above doves and sky, claps below -
too fast to count;
We were small but not alone.

In all the memories
That ever made me die
You were always

In all the motions
Of love and spite

You were always

In all the blur
Of hurt and joy

You were always

In all the dust
Of memories

You were always

You were always

You were always
