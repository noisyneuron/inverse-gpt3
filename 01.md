TEXT: i'm killing for a nice bagel and iced coffee
going on a daytime walk to nowhere
without being scared
of breathing on someone's coughs
meeting someone to call my partner
someone that could call me baby
seems  like a bad idea now
learn to make your own coffee
listen to beats online
get very high
just kidding,
i am too  scared to smoke these days
i try to follow the guidelines
i am doing okay for now
learn to be six six six six six six six  feet away

pillowed

create a storm

from this madness.

but where are all the mutants?

TEXT: is this going anywhere?
i don't think it's going anywhere.
but it keeps on going.
because when you come back home.
you do not find the warmth
and you did find some warmth
but you find that there was another warm body.
but you don't have the warmth that you found
because you do not find warmth.
so you ask yourself "where is the warmth"
but that is not where the warmth is.
you try to capture the warmth but you do not succeed in capturing it.
that is what i mean.
