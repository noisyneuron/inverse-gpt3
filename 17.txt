As your hips sway,
I'm not thinking logical
Deep longings emerge
Why can't I be logical about this?
This day seems to never end
What cha doing later?
Later in the day?
'mmm'
'please go away'
away?
'Yes, please'
'Do you realize how inappropriate you're being?'
'I almost thought this office would be safe from harassment'

on the floor that night
we drank poison
felt you hold my neck
sticky, warm

ha cha cha

we drank too much poison
but I was overprotected
and you felt overprotected too
thumping bass moved us

but the bubble popped
your sticky hands... repulse me
your breath smells sweet
you ask for my number... I'm
never calling

tail against belly
count down

when
athens
will
bring
that
heat

count
count
count
count

until you land
with a print
so small

and no capacity -
to stand

ive had too much already

i feel my heart sink

down

and into

the

my heart

to stay

inside

my body

my uninviting, small

bog body

a cold, small

room for a feeling

like that

a turgid,

feverish

room

where i belong
